# **StratifyAI Overview for Stakeholders**

## **What Is StratifyAI?**

StratifyAI is a platform that helps organizations use artificial intelligence more effectively by connecting them to many different AI providers—such as OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and others—through one unified system. Instead of learning each provider’s tools separately, StratifyAI gives you a single, simple way to work with all of them.

Think of it as a **universal adapter for AI**.

## **Why It Matters**

Most companies rely on AI for tasks like summarizing documents, analyzing data, generating content, or answering questions. But every AI provider has different strengths, costs, and limitations.

StratifyAI solves this by:

- **Choosing the best AI model for each task**
- **Reducing costs** by selecting cheaper options when appropriate
- **Improving performance** by routing work to faster or more accurate models
- **Avoiding vendor lock‑in**, so you’re never stuck with one provider
- **Simplifying the entire AI workflow** for teams and developers

It helps organizations use AI more strategically and efficiently.
